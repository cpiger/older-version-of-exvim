## Intro

EchoFunc is a useful plugin for showing c/cpp function declarations. I use it when I writing/reading functions, and need to see its parameters.

## What I changed

***Disable ( invoking echo function process***

Since I usually working on big project, writing code with auto-process is pain to me.  For efficiency, instead of invoking by ( in insert mode, I use `\ef` manually in normal mode.  You can press `\ef` on the function name to get the function declarations.

***Disable balloon declaration process***

Same reason as above.
